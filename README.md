# LambWorks framework
The LambWorks Framework (or just LambWorks) is a set of ready to use tools, libraries and project boilerplates for all kinds of projects. Everything here is C# based, but I am considering releasing some Java or C++ based counterparts. If they are released, here are the links:
|Language|Features|Link|

## Features
### Networking solution for Unity
*Asset path: LambWorks/Networking*

The networking solution is a boilerplate for creating a fully funtional multiplayer game using Unity. It consists of two different and separate systems - the server and the client - which can work independent of each other.
